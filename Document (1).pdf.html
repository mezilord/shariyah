This is the start of the document.

This is the start of the document. This standard does not cover the Murabahah transaction and its
various stages, nor does it address the issues relating to guarantees before concluding a Murabahah
deal such as promise, Hamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit), and issues relating to guarantees for recovery
of the debt created by the Murabahah transaction. This standard covers deferred payment sales that
take place on a basis other than that of Murabahah. It also covers other trust and bargaining sales.
When there is acceptance by the customer of an offer from the supplier that is either addressed to him
personally, or that has no addressee, then the sale is not concluded with the customer, and it is
permissible for the Institution to carry out Murabahah on the same item. It is not essential to exclude
any prior contractual relationship between the customer who is the purchase orderer and the original
supplier of the item ordered. It is not a requirement of Murabahah that the transaction between the
two parties must genuinely, not fictitiously, exclude any prior contractual relationship. It is permissible
to assign a contract that has been executed between the customer and the supplier of the ordered item
to the Institution. This Is the end of the document.
